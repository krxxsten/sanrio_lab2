                The founder of Sanrio, Shintaro Tsuji first began the company under the name <strong>Yamanashi Silk Company</strong> in 1960. What initally 
                began as a company made for turning silk into rubber sandals with flower detailing, turned to using cartoon characters for 
                merchandise after discovering his success gained by adding cute designs to his sandals. It was until 1973 when Sanrio first 
                established as a company.
